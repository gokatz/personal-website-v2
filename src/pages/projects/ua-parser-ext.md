Checking the browser details from the user agent string is always a part of a developer's job. In one way or another, we use online parsers to detect the browser details.

With **User Agent Parser Mozilla Add-on**, you can now get to know the browser and OS details just by selecting the user agent string (maybe from your Logs dump). Yeah, it's that simple.
