Manage and control multiple YouTube, SoundCloud, JioSaavn, Gaana, Spotify, Youtube Music tabs with ease! (more music services are on its way...)

Within the extension, you can:
 * play
 * pause
 * go to next song
 * go to previous song
 * loop song
 * start over song 

use handy shortcuts:

* Play/Pause - `Alt + K`
* Previous Song - `Alt + J`
* Next Song - `Alt + L`
* and more coming soon...

You can customize shortcuts at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`

Love to hear any feedback :)
